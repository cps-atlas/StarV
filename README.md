# StarV

StarV is a framework for monitoring and verification codesign in distributed learning-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems. It uses event-driven execution and star set reachability to verify complex behaviors of dynamical systems in real time.

- Event-driven Monitoring Architecture  
- Supports Distributed CPS with Learning Components  
- Star Set-based Reachability Analysis  
- Focus on Real-time Safety and Efficiency
